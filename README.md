This repository holds the aftermath of my visit to [OKLab Cologne](http://www.meetup.com/OKLab-Koln-Meetup/).

I put markers on an OpenLayers based map to see, where the politicians are located throughout
the city.

The initial data was kindly provided by the [city of cologne](http://www.offenedaten-koeln.de/).

It was kindly augmented by Marc Belledin with latitude/longitude information, as the original data only contained street names and post codes.

And finally, you can see a demo of the current state at http://zliw.github.io/cologne-election-candidates/
