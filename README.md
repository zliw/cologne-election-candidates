This repository holds the aftermath of my visit to [OKLab Cologne]"http://www.meetup.com/OKLab-Koln-Meetup/".

I put markers on an OpenLayers based map to see, where the politicians are located throughout
the city.

The initial data was kindly provided by the [city of cologne]"http://www.offenedaten-koeln.de/". 

It was kindly augmented by Marc Belledin with latitude/longitude information, as the original data only contained street names and post codes.
